## Team Management

Our team was split into two sub-teams, software and hardware. The hardware team was responsible for the physical design of the robot and testing the chosen parts remotely with help of the technicians.

Major tasks for them included desiging the cleaning tool and how it would be connected to and operated. Each sub-team had a leader that coordinated tasks and made sure progress was on track and blockers were effectively dealth with. The software team was responsible for writing control and interface software for the robot, as well as for the app. Their tasks were diverse, so the team was split into two parts. The first sub-team focused on computer vision and image processing, to be used in recognizing QR codes and obstructions on desks.

The second sub-team focused on navigation, whivh includes pathfinding, map-building and obstacle avoidance.
While this organization proved useful for the first few weeks of the project, the hardware team soon ran out of tasks because of the simulated nature of the project. Luckily, we had as a team made sure that everyone were up to speed with what everyone else is doing through effective communication and weekly team meetings. This allowed the hardware team to assist software on numerous tasks, and made sure there was always someone ready to help out with any problems.
