The current coronavirus pandemic how important spaces life libraries and offices are for us, but also how important and difficult it is to keep them clean and safe. ClyDe is a surface-cleaning robot meant to be deployed in these highly-trafficed spaces, where it disinfects desks after they have been used. This will assist cleaner's jobs by helping with a monotonous and repetetive task, allowing them to spend their time elsewhere.

## What can ClyDe do?

### **Surface Disinfecting**

ClyDe's main function is to autonomously clean and disinfect desk surfaces. The main target environment for ClyDe to work in are librarys, however he could also be set to work in office spaces.

ClyDe navigates throughout the environment and disinfects the surface of any desks that are marked as dirty. In order to mark desks as dirty, people are asked to scan the QR code on the table using the ClyDe Companion app. The app then changes the entry for that desk to 'dirty'.

In order to disinfect a desk, ClyDe uses his arm which has a squeegee utensil with a sponge on the end. Disinfectant is absorbed into the sponge using a pump.

## How does this system come into contact with users?

### **ClyDe Companion App**

The main way users interact with CLYDE is through our ClyDe Companion app.
#### Features

Users are only concerned with two features from the app.

The first is scanning the QR code on the table when they arrive and start using it. Since the QR code will contain the ID of the table, this allows the user to verify they are at the right table if they have booked it. This serves to let ClyDe know that the table is currently being used.

The second feature is to again scan the QR code, but this time once they have finished using the table and are leaving. This serves to let ClyDe know that the table needs to be cleaned.

It is possible in the future to integrate the app with the booking system that a library might already have in place, allowing for a more smooth user experience.

### **ClyDe Controller**
This serves as a controller for staff to interact will ClyDe in various ways, such as telling him to start patrolling as well as to come back home.
#### Features

Displays diagnostic info.

Can give instructions to ClyDe.
