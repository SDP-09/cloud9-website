The current coronavirus pandemic how important spaces life libraries and offices are for us, but also how important and difficult it is to keep them clean and safe. ClyDe is a surface-cleaning robot meant to be deployed in these highly-trafficed spaces, where it disinfects desks after they have been used. This will assist cleaner's jobs by helping with a monotonous and repetetive task, allowing them to spend their time elsewhere.

# What can ClyDe do?

### **Surface Disinfecting**

ClyDe's main function is to autonomously clean and disinfect desk surfaces. The main target environment for ClyDe to work in are librarys, however he could also be set to work in office spaces.

ClyDe navigates throughout the environment and disinfects the surface of any desks that are marked as dirty. In order to mark desks as dirty, people are asked to scan the QR code on the table using the ClyDe Companion app. The app then changes the entry for that desk to 'dirty'.

In order to disinfect a desk, ClyDe uses his arm which has a squeegee utensil with a sponge on the end. Disinfectant is absorbed into the sponge using a pump.

### **Companion App**

The main way users interact with CLYDE is through our companion app.

### **Map building with Cartographer**

In CLYDE's setup phase, it builds a map of its work area, which will later be used for navigation. A techinican will remote-control the robot with simple controls, all the while using our software to easily mark down desk locations, make their QR codes and add the desks to our database.

### **Autonomus navigation using the Navigation2 Stack**

Using the map built in the setup phase, CLYDE can navigate complex spaces and move between desks as needed.
